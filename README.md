The Jupyter Notebook titled "Tourism in Saudi Arabia" provides an analytical overview of the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia. Created as part of a university project at the College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Hafr Al-Batin,
it focuses on understanding tourism trends using data from multiple sources.

The analysis begins by introducing datasets from Booking.com, which cover 1,443 hotels across Saudi Arabia, and governmental datasets highlighting key tourism demand statistics for 2021. These include monthly visit counts, reasons for travel, 
and regional preferences among visitors.

Key objectives of the project include:
- Identifying reasons people visit Saudi Arabia.
- Analyzing the most frequently visited regions.
- Offering recommendations on budget-friendly hotels based on data.

Technically, the notebook uses popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the data.
The insights gained aim to help optimize tourism experiences for both domestic and international visitors by providing a clearer picture of demand patterns, visitor behavior, and accommodation trends.

This analysis presents a comprehensive data-driven approach to better understand and enhance the tourism sector in Saudi Arabia.
